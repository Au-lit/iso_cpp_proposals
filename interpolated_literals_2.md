Abstract: As P1819, "This paper proposes the addition of interpolated literals to the C++ language [...] Interpolated literals provide a terse and readable syntax to generate strings embedding results of C++ expressions in a human-readable manner. The proposed feature is completely decoupled from any existing Standard Library facility".
